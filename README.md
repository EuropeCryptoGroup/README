# Ethereum Classic is a project to keep original censorship-resistant Ethereum going

# Ideology
We believe in decentralized, censorship-resistant, permissionless blockchains. We believe in original vision of Ethereum as a world computer you can't shut down, running irreversible smart contracts. We believe in a strong separation of concerns, where system forks are only possible to correct actual platform bugs, not to bail out failed contracts and special interests. We believe in censorship-resistant platform that can be actually trusted.

# Motivation

It appears if we want to continue to move forward and guarantee that the original Ethereum, we must fork Ethereum. This will lay the foundation to build secure decentralized software that are actually censorship resistent.

# Plan

We fork Ethereum and maintain upstream patches similar to the relation between Redhat and CentOS, until a community can form around the project and create a road map. Until this happens we can fork multiple existing clients to help prevent a monoculture of clients. We plan to follow https://github.com/ethereum development except for any features they introduce into existing clients that violate the key principles of openness, neutrality and immutability.

### Ethereum Classic is a project to keep original censorship-resistant Ethereum going
**Have questions? Create an issue or request to be added to this project to contribute.**
## Ideology
We believe in decentralized, censorship-resistant, permissionless blockchains. We believe in the original vision of Ethereum as a world computer you can't shut down, running irreversible smart contracts. We believe in a strong separation of concerns, where system forks are only possible in order to correct actual platform bugs, not to bail out failed contracts and special interests. We believe in censorship-resistant platform that can be actually trusted - by anyone.

## Motivation
Ethereum Foundation responded to DAO debacle in the worst way possible. Special interests controlling the Foundation are ramming through DAO bailout hardfork against principled opposition of a significant economic minority of Ethereum stakeholders. According to (almost hidden, pro-fork) [Carbonvote](http://carbonvote.com/) 17% of ETH holders oppose this hardfork. Also, about 22% of Ethereum miners opposed the previous 'DAO softfork' and would logically oppose hardfork as well. This significant minority should not be silenced or intimidated into submission - they should be given a choice. 

It appears if we want to continue to move forward and guarantee survival of the original Ethereum vision, we must fork Ethereum. This will lay the foundation to build secure decentralized software that are actually censorship resistent.

## Goals

The main goal of the projet is to ensure survival of the original Ethereum blockchain. We will strive to provide alternative for people who strongly disagree with DAO bailout and the direction Ethereum Foundation is taking their project. Anyone opting to remain on the original chain should have such opportunity.

## Plan

### Development
We fork Ethereum and maintain upstream patches similar to the relation between Redhat and CentOS, until a community can form around the project and create a road map. Until this happens we can fork multiple existing clients to help prevent a monoculture of clients. We plan to follow https://github.com/ethereum development except for any features they introduce into existing clients that violate the key principles of openness, neutrality and immutability.

## What can I do?

Please help us spread the word about this project in Ethereum community! 

### Volunteers
If you feel strongly about the cause, please get involved. With just days before the planned hardfork, we need your support to ensure original Ethereum survival. We need more developers, people can put website together quickly, people who can write and advocate the need to preserve the original Ethereum. Please let us know what are your skills and how you would like to contribute. Redditors, please [reply here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/4sxupj/making_sure_original_ethereum_survives_please_get/). Github users, please [open new issue](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/README/issues/new). Let's make sure original Ethereum vision doesn't 'go gentle into that good night'!

### Users

In order to remain on the original chain, just don't upgrade to hardfork client version pushed by Ethereum Foundation. We will maintain non-fork versions of all major Ethereum clients (as well as other key software), so going forwards all the improvements will be available to you.

### Miners

Miners supporting the original chain should just keep mining with current version of software for now, without upgrading to client version introducing the hardfork code. It will be always possible to download and build latest non-fork version from https://github.com/ethereumclassic. 

The difficulty of the original chain will be quite high post-fork, but it will adjust to actual hashrate shortly (just 2048 blocks, a few hours). Since it is expected that a most hashrate will move to hardfoked chain, post-adjustment it will be possible to obtain decent mining rewards in original chain ETH even with solo mining.

Mining pool supporting the originar chain is currently under development, please check here in a couple of days.
